Welcome to the SBMLNetwork documentation! This document provides an overview of the SBMLNetwork library, installation instructions, and usage examples.

## Overview

SBMLNetwork is a tool that enables software developers and systems biologists to work with the graphical representation of SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language) models. It makes use of the SBML Layout and Render extensions to provide a comprehensive set of functionalities for working with the graphical representation of SBML models.

## Features

The SBMLNetwork library offers the following features:

- A Python package that provides a high-level API for working with the graphical representation of SBML models
- A C++ backend library that implements the core functionalities of the SBMLNetwork library
- A built-in high-performance autolayout algorithm that automatically generates and adds graphical representation data to SBML models that donâ€™t have them
- A comprehensive API that provides the users and developers with seamless access to the graphical representation attributes of SBML models
- A tool to view SBML models as an image using their Layout and Render data.

## Getting started
